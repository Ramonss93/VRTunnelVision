## VR Tunnel Vision Effect in Unreal Engine 4

This is the sample Unreal Engine 4 project I created as part of this YouTube tutorial: [Recreated: Google Earth VR Tunnel Vision Effect](tbd)

The visual assets in this project come from the excellent "Lanscape Mountains" learning content from Epic Games. You can download the original Landscape Mountains project from the Epic Games Launcher (Learn > Landscape Mountains).

You may use this project in any way you like.
